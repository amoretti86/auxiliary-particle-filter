'''
Implements the Fully Adapted Auxiliary Particle Filter as described by Whiteley and Johansen
Chapter 3 Algorithm 2 on page 5 of Recent Developments in Auxiliary Particle Filtering:
http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~manpw/apf_chapter.pdf

The algorithm is modified to perform inference in nonlinear dynamical systems and supports
the Fitzhugh Nagumo model (or Van der Pol Oscillator)

    Algorithm 2 on page 5: http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~manpw/apf_chapter.pdf

    Input: 
    (obs):          a time x dimension matrix representing a time series of observed signals
    (time):         a scalar representing the corresponding time length
    (n_particles):  a scalar representing the number of particles to use in the simulation
    (n_gridpoints): a scalar representing the number of grid points or nodes to use for the quadrature
    (B):            a 2x2 propagator matrix for the dynamics
    (Sigma):        a 2x2 covariance matrix
    (Gamma):        a 2x2 covariance matrix
    (x_0):          a 2x1 vector of representing the initial value of the signal
    (I_ext):        a scalar representing input current magnitude

    Output: 
    (W) : an n_particles x time matrix of weights
    (X) : an n_particles x time x dimension tensor of trajectories
    (k) : an n_particles x time matrix of the posterior integral for each particle at each time point

    Averaging the trajectory tensor across particles approximates the functional integral
    The predicted signals obtained by averaging X may also be smoothed by applying a moving average
